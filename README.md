# Blynk - Skill Path Navigator

**Blynk** is a next-generation learning platform that dynamically generates **personalized learning roadmaps**. Instead of following a fixed curriculum, users define their learning goals, and Blynk creates a tailored path with interactive micro-courses, quizzes, and progress tracking.

> “Blynk: The platform that *builds your learning journey* for you — one skill at a time.”

## Concept

Students input a learning goal, for example:

“I want to learn AI” or “I want to become a full-stack developer.”

Copy code

Blynk then generates a **dynamic skill roadmap**:

Learn Python → Data Structures → ML Basics → Deep Learning → Final Project

Copy code

Each node is clickable and links to micro-courses, quizzes, or resources.
